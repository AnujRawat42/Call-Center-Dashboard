## Problem Statement

The management team requires a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics critical to the centerâ€™s operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The dashboard should offer clear insights into overall customer satisfaction, call handling efficiency, and agent performance. The goal is to provide actionable data that helps improve service quality, optimize resource allocation, and enhance decision-making.
Here is the [DATA FILE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16E-EZy_nZsLDDi8aMrjlHC5IK7icSgMa?usp=drive_link)

## Key KPIs

- **Customer Satisfaction**: Measuring overall customer experience.
- **Call Handling Metrics**: Total calls answered vs. abandoned, categorized by time.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Average speed of answer, call duration, and peak call times.
- **Agent Performance**: Analyzing agent effectiveness using a quadrant view of average handle time (talk duration) vs. calls answered.



### Steps followed 

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded the call center dataset into Power Query.
- Checked the column distribution to understand data structure and quality.

### 2. Measure Creation
- Created a measure for answered calls:
  ```DAX
  Answered = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Call Id]), FILTER(Sheet1, Sheet1[Answered (Y/N)] = "Y"))
- Created a measure for resolved calls:
    ```DAX
  Resolved(Y) = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Call Id]), FILTER(Sheet1, Sheet1[Resolved] = "Y"))
### 3. Dashboard Visuals
- **Gauge**: Displayed the average satisfaction rating of agents.
- **Column Chart**: Visualized the number of calls per month.

### 4. Agent Statistics

  - Number of resolved calls
  - Number of answered calls
